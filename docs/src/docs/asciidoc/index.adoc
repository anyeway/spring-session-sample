Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information. It also provides transparent integration with:

* <<httpsession,HttpSession>> - allows replacing the HttpSession in an application container (i.e. Tomcat) neutral way.
Additional features include:
** **Clustered Sessions** - Spring Session makes it trivial to support <<httpsession-redis,clustered sessions>> without being tied to an application container specific solution.
** **Multiple Browser Sessions** - Spring Session supports <<httpsession-multi,managing multiple users' sessions>> in a single browser instance (i.e. multiple authenticated accounts similar to Google).
** **RESTful APIs** - Spring Session allows providing session ids in headers to work with <<httpsession-rest,RESTful APIs>>

* <<websocket,WebSocket>> - provides the ability to keep the `HttpSession` alive when receiving WebSocket messages

[[httpsession]]
== HttpSession Integration

Spring Session provides transparent integration with `HttpSession`.
This means that developers can switch the `HttpSession` implementation out with an implementation that is backed by Spring Session.

[[httpsession-why]]
=== Why Spring Session & HttpSession?

We have already mentioned that Spring Session provides transparent integration with `HttpSession`, but what benefits do we get out of this?

* **Clustered Sessions** - Spring Session makes it trivial to support <<httpsession-redis,clustered sessions>> without being tied to an application container specific solution.
* **Multiple Browser Sessions** - Spring Session supports <<httpsession-multi,managing multiple users' sessions>> in a single browser instance (i.e. multiple authenticated accounts similar to Google).
* **RESTful APIs** - Spring Session allows providing session ids in headers to work with <<httpsession-rest,RESTful APIs>>

[[httpsession-redis]]
=== HttpSession with Redis

Using Spring Session with `HttpSession` is enabled by adding a Servlet Filter before anything that uses the `HttpSession`.
You can choose from enabling this using either:

* <<httpsession-redis-jc,Java Based Configuration>>
* <<httpsession-redis-xml,XML Based Configuration>>

[[httpsession-redis-jc]]
==== Redis Java Based Configuration

This section describes how to use Redis to back `HttpSession` using Java based configuration.

NOTE: The <<samples, HttpSession Sample>> provides a working sample on how to integrate Spring Session and `HttpSession` using XML configuration.
You can read the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed HttpSession Guide when integrating with your own application.

include::guides/httpsession.adoc[tags=config,leveloffset=+3]

[[httpsession-redis-xml]]
==== Redis XML Based Configuration

This section describes how to use Redis to back `HttpSession` using XML based configuration.

NOTE: The <<samples, HttpSession XML Sample>> provides a working sample on how to integrate Spring Session and `HttpSession` using XML configuration.
You can read the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed HttpSession XML Guide when integrating with your own application.

include::guides/httpsession-xml.adoc[tags=config,leveloffset=+3]

[[httpsession-how]]
=== How HttpSession Integration Works

Fortunately both `HttpSession` and `HttpServletRequest` (the API for obtaining an `HttpSession`) are both interfaces.
This means that we can provide our own implementations for each of these APIs.

NOTE: This section describes how Spring Session provides transparent integration with `HttpSession`. The intent is so that user's can understand what is happening under the covers. This functionality is already integrated and you do NOT need to implement this logic yourself.

First we create a custom `HttpServletRequest` that returns a custom implementation of `HttpSession`.
It looks something like the following:

[source, java]
----
public class SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper extends HttpServletRequestWrapper {

	public SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper(HttpServletRequest original) {
		super(original);
	}

	public HttpSession getSession() {
		return getSession(true);
	}

	public HttpSession getSession(boolean createNew) {
		// create an HttpSession implementation from Spring Session
	}

	// ... other methods delegate to the original HttpServletRequest ...
}
----

Any method that returns an `HttpSession` is overridden.
All other methods are implemented by `HttpServletRequestWrapper` and simply delegate to the original `HttpServletRequest` implementation.

We replace the `HttpServletRequest` implementation using a servlet `Filter` called `SessionRepositoryFilter`.
The pseudocode can be found below:

[source, java]
----
public class SessionRepositoryFilter implements Filter {

	public doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
		HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;
		SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper customRequest =
			new SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper(httpRequest);

		chain.doFilter(customRequest, response, chain);
	}

	// ...
}
----

By passing in a custom `HttpServletRequest` implementation into the `FilterChain` we ensure that anything invoked after our `Filter` uses the custom `HttpSession` implementation.
This highlights why it is important that Spring Session's `SessionRepositoryFilter` must be placed before anything that interacts with the `HttpSession`.

[[httpsession-multi]]
=== Multiple HttpSessions in Single Browser

Spring Session has the ability to support multiple sessions in a single browser instance.
This provides the ability to support authenticating with multiple users in the same browser instance (i.e. Google Accounts).

NOTE: The <<samples,Manage Multiple Users Guide>> provides a complete working example of managing multiple users in the same browser instance.
You can follow the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed Manage Multiple Users Guide when integrating with your own application.

include::guides/users.adoc[tags=how-does-it-work,leveloffset=+1]

[[httpsession-rest]]
=== HttpSession & RESTful APIs

Spring Session can work with RESTful APIs by allowing the session to be provided in a header.


NOTE: The <<samples, REST Sample>> provides a working sample on how to use Spring Session in a REST application to support authenticating with a header.
You can follow the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed REST Guide when integrating with your own application.

include::guides/rest.adoc[tags=config,leveloffset=+1]


[[websocket]]
== WebSocket Integration

Spring Session provides transparent integration with Spring's WebSocket support.

include::guides/websocket.adoc[tags=disclaimer,leveloffset=+1]

[[websocket-why]]
=== Why Spring Session & WebSockets?

So why do we need Spring Session when using WebSockets?

Consider an email application that does much of its work through HTTP requests.
However, there is also a chat application embedded within it that works over WebSocket APIs.
If a user is actively chatting with someone, we should not timeout the `HttpSession` since this would be pretty poor user experience.
However, this is exactly what https://java.net/jira/browse/WEBSOCKET_SPEC-175[JSR-356] does.

Another issue is that according to JSR-356 if the `HttpSession` times out any WebSocket that was created with that HttpSession and an authenticated user should be forcibly closed.
This means that if we are actively chatting in our application and are not using the HttpSession, then we will also disconnect from our conversation!

[[websocket-usage]]
=== WebSocket Usage

The <<samples, WebSocket Sample>> provides a working sample on how to integrate Spring Session with WebSockets.
You can follow the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed WebSocket Guide when integrating with your own application:

[[websocket-httpsession]]
==== HttpSession Integration

Before using WebSocket integration, you should be sure that you have <<httpsession>> working first.

include::guides/websocket.adoc[tags=config,leveloffset=+2]

[[api]]
== API Documentation

You can browse the complete link:../../api/[Javadoc] online. The key APIs are described below:

[[api-session]]
=== Session

A `Session` is a simplified `Map` of name value pairs.

Typical usage might look like the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{indexdoc-tests}[tags=repository-demo]
----

<1> We create a `SessionRepository` instance with a generic type, `S`, that extends `Session`. The generic type is defined in our class.
<2> We create a new `Session` using our `SessionRepository` and assign it to a variable of type `S`.
<3> We interact with the `Session`. In our example, we demonstrate saving a `User` to the `Session`.
<4> We now save the `Session`. This is why we needed the generic type `S`. The `SessionRepository` only allows saving `Session` instances that were created or retrieved using the same `SessionRepository`. This allows for the `SessionRepository` to make implementation specific optimizations (i.e. only writing attributes that have changed).
<5> We retrieve the `Session` from the `SessionRepository`.
<6> We obtain the persisted `User` from our `Session` without the need for explicitly casting our attribute.

[[api-expiringsession]]
=== ExpiringSession

An `ExpiringSession` extends a `Session` by providing attributes related to the `Session` instance's expiration.
If there is no need to interact with the expiration information, prefer using the more simple `Session` API.

Typical usage might look like the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{indexdoc-tests}[tags=expire-repository-demo]
----

<1> We create a `SessionRepository` instance with a generic type, `S`, that extends `ExpiringSession`. The generic type is defined in our class.
<2> We create a new `ExpiringSession` using our `SessionRepository` and assign it to a variable of type `S`.
<3> We interact with the `ExpiringSession`.
In our example, we demonstrate updating the amount of time the `ExpiringSession` can be inactive before it expires.
<4> We now save the `ExpiringSession`.
This is why we needed the generic type `S`.
The `SessionRepository` only allows saving `ExpiringSession` instances that were created or retrieved using the same `SessionRepository`.
This allows for the `SessionRepository` to make implementation specific optimizations (i.e. only writing attributes that have changed).
The last accessed time is automatically updated when the `ExpiringSession` is saved.
<5> We retrieve the `ExpiringSession` from the `SessionRepository`.
If the `ExpiringSession` were expired, the result would be null.

[[api-sessionrepository]]
=== SessionRepository

A `SessionRepository` is in charge of creating, retrieving, and persisting `Session` instances.

If possible, developers should not interact directly with a `SessionRepository` or a `Session`.
Instead, developers should prefer interacting with `SessionRepository` and `Session` indirectly through the <<httpsession,HttpSession>> and <<websocket,WebSocket>> integration.

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository]]
=== RedisOperationsSessionRepository

`RedisOperationsSessionRepository` is a `SessionRepository` that is implemented using Spring Data's `RedisOperations`.
In a web environment, this is typically used in combination with `SessionRepositoryFilter`.
The implementation supports `SessionDestroyedEvent` through `SessionMessageListener`.

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository-new]]
==== Instantiating a RedisOperationsSessionRepository

A typical example of how to create a new instance can be seen below:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{indexdoc-tests}[tags=new-redisoperationssessionrepository]
----

For additional information on how to create a `RedisConnectionFactory`, refer to the Spring Data Redis Reference.

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository-storage]]
==== Storage Details

Each session is stored in Redis as a Hash.
Each session is set and updated using the HMSET command.
An example of how each session is stored can be seen below.

	HMSET spring:session:sessions:<session-id> creationTime 1404360000000 \
		maxInactiveInterval 1800 lastAccessedTime 1404360000000 \
		sessionAttr:<attrName> someAttrValue sessionAttr:<attrName2> someAttrValue2

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository-expiration]]
===== Session Expiration

An expiration is associated to each session using the EXPIRE command based upon the RedisOperationsSessionRepository.RedisSession.getMaxInactiveInterval().
For example:

	EXPIRE spring:session:sessions:<session-id> 1800

Spring Session relies on the expired and delete http://redis.io/topics/notifications[keyspace notifications] from Redis to fire a <<SessionDestroyedEvent>>.
It is the `SessionDestroyedEvent` that ensures resources associated with the Session are cleaned up.
For example, when using Spring Session's WebSocket support the Redis expired or delete event is what triggers any WebSocket connections associated with the session to be closed.

One problem with this approach is that Redis makes no guarantee of when the expired event will be fired if they key has not been accessed.
Specifically the background task that Redis uses to clean up expired keys is a low priority task and may not trigger the key expiration.
For additional details see http://redis.io/topics/notifications[Timing of expired events] section in the Redis documentation.

To circumvent the fact that expired events are not guaranteed to happen we can ensure that each key is accessed when it is expected to expire.
This means that if the TTL is expired on the key, Redis will remove the key and fire the expired event when we try to access they key.

For this reason, each session expiration is also tracked to the nearest minute.
This allows a background task to access the potentially expired sessions to ensure that Redis expired events are fired in a more deterministic fashion.
For example:

SADD spring:session:expirations:<expire-rounded-up-to-nearest-minute> <session-id>
EXPIRE spring:session:expirations:<expire-rounded-up-to-nearest-minute> 1860

The background task will then use these mappings to explicitly request each key.
By accessing they key, rather than deleting it, we ensure that Redis deletes the key for us only if the TTL is expired.

NOTE: We do not explicitly delete the keys since in some instances there may be a race condition that incorrectly identifies a key as expired when it is not.
Short of using distributed locks (which would kill our performance) there is no way to ensure the consistency of the expiration mapping.
By simply accessing the key, we ensure that the key is only removed if the TTL on that key is expired.

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository-writes]]
===== Optimized Writes

The `Session` instances managed by `RedisOperationsSessionRepository` keeps track of the properties that have changed and only updates those.
This means if an attribute is written once and read many times we only need to write that attribute once.
For example, assume the session attribute "sessionAttr2" from earlier was updated.
The following would be executed upon saving:

HMSET spring:session:sessions:<session-id> sessionAttr:<attrName2> newValue
EXPIRE spring:session:sessions:<session-id> 1800

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository-sessiondestroyedevent]]
==== SessionDestroyedEvent

`RedisOperationsSessionRepository` supports firing a `SessionDestroyedEvent` whenever a `Session` is deleted or when it expires.
This is necessary to ensure resources associated with the `Session` are properly cleaned up.
For example, when integrating with WebSockets the `SessionDestroyedEvent` is in charge of closing any active WebSocket connections.

Firing a `SessionDestroyedEvent` is made available through the `SessionMessageListener` which listens to http://redis.io/topics/notifications[Redis Keyspace events].
In order for this to work, Redis Keyspace events for Generic commands and Expired events needs to be enabled.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
redis-cli config set notify-keyspace-events Egx
----

If you are using `@EnableRedisHttpSession` the `SessionMessageListener` and enabling the necessary Redis Keyspace events is done automatically.
However, in a secured Redis enviornment the config command is disabled.
This means that Spring Session cannot configure Redis Keyspace events for you.
To disable the automatic configuration add `ConfigureRedisAction.NO_OP` as a bean.

For example, Java Configuration can use the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{docs-test-dir}docs/RedisHttpSessionConfigurationNoOpConfigureRedisActionTests.java[tags=configure-redis-action]
----

XML Configuraiton can use the following:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{docs-test-resources-dir}docs/HttpSessionConfigurationNoOpConfigureRedisActionXmlTests-context.xml[tags=configure-redis-action]
----

[[api-redisoperationssessionrepository-cli]]
==== Viewing the Session in Redis

After http://redis.io/topics/quickstart[installing redis-cli], you can inspect the values in Redis http://redis.io/commands#hash[using the redis-cli].
For example, enter the following into a terminal:

[source,bash]
----
$ redis-cli
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "spring:session:sessions:4fc39ce3-63b3-4e17-b1c4-5e1ed96fb021" <1>
2) "spring:session:expirations:1418772300000" <2>
----

<1> The suffix of this key is the session identifier of the Spring Session.
<2> This key contains all the session ids that should be deleted at the time `1418772300000`.

You can also view the attributes of each session.

[source,bash]
----
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> hkeys spring:session:sessions:4fc39ce3-63b3-4e17-b1c4-5e1ed96fb021
1) "lastAccessedTime"
2) "creationTime"
3) "maxInactiveInterval"
4) "sessionAttr:username"
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> hget spring:session:sessions:4fc39ce3-63b3-4e17-b1c4-5e1ed96fb021 sessionAttr:username
"\xac\xed\x00\x05t\x00\x03rob"
----

[[api-mapsessionrepository]]
=== MapSessionRepository

The `MapSessionRepository` allows for persisting `ExpiringSession` in a `Map` with the key being the `ExpiringSession` id and the value being the `ExpiringSession`.
The implementation can be used with a `ConcurrentHashMap` as a testing or convenience mechanism.
Alternatively, it can be used with distributed `Map` implementations. For example, it can be used with Hazelcast.

[[api-mapsessionrepository-new]]
==== Instantiating MapSessionRepository

Creating a new instance is as simple as:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{indexdoc-tests}[tags=new-mapsessionrepository]
----

[[api-mapsessionrepository-hazelcast]]
==== Using Spring Session and Hazlecast

The <<samples,Hazelcast Sample>> is a complete application demonstrating using Spring Session with Hazelcast.
To run it use the following:

	./gradlew :samples:hazelcast:tomcatRun
